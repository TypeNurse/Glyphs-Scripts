# ABOUT
Python scripts for Glyphs font editor. Should be compatible with both version 2 and 3.

## Components and Composites
* **Add Missing Composites for Stylistic Sets:** Add composite glyphs for letters in stylistic sets where the standard glyph is used as component. Useful to maintain consistency in glyph set when adding a new styilistic set.
* **Make Component Smart:** Turn (the glyphs of) the selected components into smart components based on the axes defined in the font, thus making the interpolatable. Useful for e.g. small caps and ordinals, depending on your setup.
* **Make Component Dumb(er):** Turn (the glyphs of) the selected smart components into regular components i.e. reversing the *Make Component Smart* script.
* **New Tab with Glyphs Using Glyph(s) as Component:** Opens a new tab with all glyphs using selected glyphs as components. Same as *”Show all glyphs that uses ...”* in Edit view, but works for multiple glyphs. Each glyphs reports on a separate line of text.
* **Set Kerning Groups for Composite Glyphs:** Sets missing kerning groups for selected composite glyphs based on included components (ignoring marks). Also works for ligatures.

## Glyph Properties
* **Lock/Unlock Glyphs:** Locks or unlocks selected glyphs, resulting in the same lock state for the entire selection. *Recommended shortcut:* ⌘L
* **Toggle Glyph Lock:** Toggles the lock state for selected glyphs. Unlike the above, the lock state if not harmonized across the selection. *Recommended shortcut:* ⌥⌘L
* **Swap Glyph Names:** Exchanges the names of two selected glyphs. All other glyph data remains unchanged.

## Other
* **Remove Annotation:** Deletes all annotation (in all layers) for selected glyphs.
* **Reverse Selected Text:** Reverses (i.e. LTR ⇄ RTL) *selected* text in Edit view. Preserves layers shown and line breaks. Useful in LTR+RTL fonts so you can type test words without have to do it backwards. :)
